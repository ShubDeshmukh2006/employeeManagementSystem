## Overview

This system provides a centralised interface for HR and administrative tasks. It supports full CRUD operations across four entities — Employees, Departments, Projects, and Dependents — with a live dashboard summarising key metrics via interactive charts.

The application runs entirely locally using SQLite and requires no external database setup. On first launch, the database is auto-created and seeded with sample data.

## Features

- KPI cards showing total employees, departments, projects, and dependents
- Donut chart: employee distribution by department
- Bar chart: project budgets by department

**Employees**
- Add, edit (double-click row), and delete employee records
- Fields: name, email, phone, salary, department
